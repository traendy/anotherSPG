Squared Space is a simple Android arcade space shooter game.



Your space ship shoots. You try to hit all obstacles on the screen to get points.
Power ups increase your abilities and it is getting harder over time.



It is written without a game developer framework. Instead I tried to implement everything myself with no to little game development experience.



It is basically drawing rects on a canvas and iterating over them to update their states.



If you are interested you can check out the [repository](https://github.com/traendy/squaredspace) or [download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.traendy.spaceshooter) the game to your Android device.



For now the development rests. Because its getting hard to improve or add new features to the code base. 



Maybe Squared Space 2 will come to your device some day. Stay tuned :)
